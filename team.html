                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Founded in 2011, AFK began with a simple yet ambitious idea: to make healthier cooking accessible to everyone. Starting as a small family-run business, we quickly realized that the demand for efficient, easy-to-use cooking technology was growing. This realization led to the development of our first product which would change the way people prepared their meals at home.</p>
                        <p>From our humble beginnings, we've expanded our product line to include a wide variety of air fryers designed for every household, each built with cutting-edge technology that allows for healthier cooking. Our commitment to quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction has fueled our growth, making AFK a trusted name in kitchens across the globe.</p>
                        <p>What began as a passion for better cooking has grown into a global company, constantly evolving to meet the needs of our customers. Today, we are proud to continue our mission to revolutionize home cooking with products that save time, reduce fat, and enhance flavor. We're excited about the future and what's to come as we continue to innovate and inspire.</p>
